  <h2>About the Founder</h2>
  <h4>
    Steven McDaniel is a guy that was born on August 18, 2004. In third grade, the teacher gave the class a coding assignment, where they had to use block code (Scratch)<br>
    to code something (He doesn't remember what, though). He got frustrated for the first half of school, mostly because he was confused on what he had to do. But the more<br>
    he practiced, the better he got at it. It was then, at that point, he realized how fun it was, and then he knew what he wanted to do for his life.
